1. What is monolithic software?
Monolithic software is software that uses monolithic design architecture, which is a unified design model that is self-contained and
independent from other software. This means that all of the application's functionality, such as UI, business logic, and data access is tightly
integrated into one large application.
2. When is it advised to build monolithic software?
An example of scenarios to implement monolithic architecture:
1: small to medium-sized applications
2: during the early stages of developing or prototyping
3. If the requirements are clear and simple: If the application requirements are stable and not expected to change drastically, a monolithic
system can be appropriate.
4-Limited Resources: Monolithic architectures require fewer resources, both in terms of infrastructure and development, as they can run on a
single server and don't need the complexity of managing multiple services.
3: What are the most common architectural styles for monolithic systems? And what are its advantages?
1-common architecture styles:
1 presentation layer
2: business logic layer
3-data layer
2-advantages of monolithic architecture
1. Simplicity: Monolithic applications are easier to design and manage at the start because all the components are together, that reduces
development complexity.
2: Performance: Since everything runs in the same memory space, data exchanges between layers can be faster than in distributed systems.
3. Simple Deployment: Deployment is often easier because it involves deploying a single package or executable, reducing the complexities
associated with distributed deployments.
4: Easier to Manage in the Short Term: For small teams, monolithic architectures are usually more manageable because there is no need to
coordinate changes across multiple services.
